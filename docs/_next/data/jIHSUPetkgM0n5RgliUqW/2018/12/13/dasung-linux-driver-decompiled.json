Dasung ships their monitors with a Linux driver that is sadly limited to the Ubuntu amd64 architecture. The driver can be downloaded from:\n<a href=\"http://www.dasungtech.com/sta/en/software_en0310.html\">Dasung driver download page</a></p>\n<p>I have decompiled the drivers and uploaded them to github at:\n<a href=\"https://github.com/kevzettler/decompiled_dasung_drivers\">Dasung linux drivers source code decompiled</a></p>\n<p>I was naively hoping I could hack this to be ARM compatible so I could use the Dasung with a Raspberry PI. I have been told that is not feasible due to architecture differences and OS API compatibility concerns. However these Drivers can potentially be used to make mods for other AMD64 systems.</p>\n<p>When looking at the &#39;drivers&#39; provided by Dasung the contents of the Ubuntu folder are as follows:</p>\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\"><code class=\"language-bash\">-rwxrwxrwx@ 1 kev  staff  67646 Nov  2  2017 DS.ico\n-rwxrwxrwx@ 1 kev  staff  29404 Nov  2  2017 paperlikepro_1.0.5_amd64.deb\n-rwxrwxrwx@ 1 kev  staff    180 Nov  2  2017 readme</code>\n</pre>\n<ul><li><code>DS.ico</code><p>is an icon file of the Dasung logo</p>\n</li>\n<li><code>readme</code><p>is a text file explaining how to install the driver on Ubuntu systems</p>\n</li>\n<li><code>paperlikepro_1.0.5_amd64.deb</code><p>is a Debian package archive containing the compiled driver and other data. The <code>deb</code> file can be extracted to the following contents:</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>paperlikepro_1.0.5_amd64.deb contents</h2>\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\"><code class=\"language-bash\">-rw-r--r--@ 1 kev  staff    279 Aug  4  2017 control.tar.gz\n-rw-r--r--@ 1 kev  staff  28932 Aug  4  2017 data.tar.xz\n-rw-r--r--@ 1 kev  staff      4 Aug  4  2017 debian-binary</code>\n</pre>\n<ul><li><code>debian-binary</code>is a text file that contains a version number<code>$ cat debian-binary 2.0</code></li>\n<li><code>control.tar.gz</code>is an archive that can be extracted using <code>tar</code>it expands to a text file <code>control</code> with the following content:</li>\n</ul>\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\"><code class=\"language-unknown\">$ cat control\nPackage: PaperlikePro\nVersion: 1.0.5\nSection: x11\nPriority: standard\nArchitecture: amd64\nDepends:\nInstalled-Size: 200\nMaintainer: support@dasung.com\nDescription: Paperlike Pro Software</code>\n</pre>\n<ul><li><code>data.tar.xz</code><p>This is where things get interesting. It is another tar archive which contains the executables of the driver.

We have already seen <code>DS.ico</code> and know it is the Dasung logo.</p>\n<p><code>PaperLikePro</code> and <code>ResChange</code> are both executables. I am assuming that <code>PaperlikePro</code> is the UI management tool found on other platforms and that <code>ResChange</code> is a resolution driving tool.</p>\n<h1>Converting amd64 binaries to other format</h1>\n<p>Using the <a href=\"https://github.com/yegord/snowman\">Snowman decompiler</a> tool against <code>PaperlikePro</code> and <code>ResChange</code> binaries I was able to produce some C++ decompiled source code. I have not attempted to re compile them and see if they work as expected. I have uploaded the decompiled code to github at <a href=\"https://github.com/kevzettler/decompiled_dasung_drivers\"><a href=\"https://github.com/kevzettler/decompiled_dasung_drivers\">https://github.com/kevzettler/decompiled_dasung_drivers</a></a>.</p>\n","excerpt":"This is a follow up to the Dasung teardown post in which I decompile the software drivers.
