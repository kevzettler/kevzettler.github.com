Some of the tech decisions made sense during development but are questionable today. I will try to address that in this post. I started this project with very minimal game development experience. I had no idea how many things worked, shaders, 3d asset files, raw binary buffer manipulation, scene graphs, and physics engines. I learned all these skills and more during this project. This experience also helped me later land some major corporate jobs.

I was very inspired by \u003ccode\u003e.io\u003c/code\u003e games and sites like \u003ca href=\"https://iogames.space/\"\u003eiogames.space\u003c/a\u003e. I love the \u003ccode\u003e.io\u003c/code\u003e gaming experience of copy-pasting a URL around and getting in a game with your friends. Furthermore, I wanted to recreate a canceled MMO called \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exteel\"\u003eExteel\u003c/a\u003e. My background was in web development and design. I stuck with the tools and environment I was most familiar with.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eTarget features\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003enetwork multiplayer\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eplayable cross-platform in the browser\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ePlayer avatar customization\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003elazy loading assets\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eshared client \u0026#38; server game code\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ethird person camera\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eplatforming physics\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003edestructible environments\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI completed most of these features except for destructible environments. Destructible environments were a big driver for the voxel asset pipeline, assuming voxels would enable the destructibility. Another browser game \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/Lallassu/VoxLords\"\u003eVoxLords\u003c/a\u003e inspired the goal of destructible environments. VoxLords had good environmental destruction and captured my imagination. I started this out by forking and modifying VoxLords to be multiplayer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/lallassu/status/725401257377169409?s=20\"\u003ehttps://twitter.com/lallassu/status/725401257377169409?s=20\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter hacking on VoxLords, it was clear that making a captivating 3D multiplayer browser experience was possible. Unfortunately, Lallassu was correct, and there were some major performance issues in the VoxLords engine that would require extensive refactoring. I decided to start a new project.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eWhy I didn\u0026#39;t use one of the megacorp engines\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was not happy with Unity and Unreal\u0026#39;s HTML5 browser experience. Unity\u0026#39;s HTML5 export creates a giant asset bundle where users must sit and watch a loading bar before playing. This loading bar experience was against my goals of lazy loading assets on demand. Additionally, Unity\u0026#39;s multiplayer server-side support was sketchy and \u003ca href=\"https://radcade.com/unity-multiplayer-netcode-for-gameobjects/\"\u003estill is\u003c/a\u003e. Unreal had much stronger multiplayer support but similar issues with browser builds, and in addition, Unreal itself was too large to install on my laptop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eThe work\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter hacking the VoxLords multiplayer fork, I started by exploring multiple tech stacks concurrently and building a prototype in each. The stacks I looked at were Babylon.js, Three.js, \u0026#38; Stackgl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eTech stack requirements\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first requirement was support for the 3d asset pipeline. I had been working with voxel models in \u003ca href=\"https://ephtracy.github.io/\"\u003eMagicaVoxel .vox\u003c/a\u003e format. The .vox format was great for static entities. There are primarily two ways to animate a voxel model. You can create frame-based animation, in which each frame is a separate voxel animation, and then you morph or swap them out at runtime. Or you can apply skeletal transformation data to voxel meshes. If you decide on the skeletal route, you must break the voxel mesh into smaller meshes corresponding to the skeleton bones.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had a character mesh that I wanted to use in .vox format, but at the time MagicaVoxel did not support multiple meshes. I converted the .vox file to \u003ca href=\"https://www.getqubicle.com/\"\u003equiblce .qb\u003c/a\u003e file and broke the character up into separate meshes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ca href='/img/multiplayer-engine-post/qubicle.png'\u003e\n  \u003cimg src='/img/multiplayer-engine-post/qubicle.png'\n       alt=\"Qubicle UI breaking a mesh up.\"\n       title=\"Using Qubicle to break up a mesh for skeletal animation\"/\u003e\n\u003c/a\u003e\u003cp\u003eI then imported the segmented Qubicle mesh into Blender and built the skeletal animations in Blender.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ca href='/img/multiplayer-engine-post/blender.gif'\u003e\n  \u003cimg src='/img/multiplayer-engine-post/blender.gif'\n       alt=\"Blender skeletal walking animation.\"\n       title=\"Voxel model animated in Blender with skeletal animation\"/\u003e\n\u003c/a\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe engine then combines the animation data and voxel mesh data at runtime.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eTech stack evaluation\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://threejs.org/\"\u003ethree.js\u003c/a\u003e\u003cp\u003eI looked at Three.js first because VoxLords was built with it. The Three.js - Blender pipeline had issues, and we could not utilize skeletal animation imports. A colleague of mine who was working on a Three.js project captured some of the \u003ca href=\"https://gist.github.com/AndrewRayCode/746be166c3008a03167206aec4a46531\"\u003e three.js blender exporter issues\u003c/a\u003e at the time. The Three.js - Blender compatibility issues were a deal breaker for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFurthermore, Three.js did not have a viable headless server-side offering. Three.js uses custom math libraries that were not easily extractable from the rendering code. This tight coupling of math primitives and client render code meant multiplayer support would take a lot of extra duplicate work, re-implementing the game logic on the server. Three.js has advanced significantly since then, and I don\u0026#39;t think these are issues anymore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.babylonjs.com/\"\u003ebabylon.js\u003c/a\u003e\u003cp\u003eI made some immediate promising progress in Babylon.js. The asset pipeline was robust and supported skeletal animation data. Babylon has a camera and physics out of the box. The Babylon team and community were super responsive and supportive. I hit a wall with Babylon.js when building the multiplayer server. Like Three.js, Babylon.js had no headless mode. Again, building multiplayer would require duplicate work reproducing all the simulation logic and physics in the server-side codebase. Recent versions of Babylon have a robust headless mode and have decoupled the framework into smaller libraries. These days Three.js is the king of the normie mindshare lexicon, but I still find Babylon.js a much better offering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://stack.gl/\"\u003estackgl\u003c/a\u003e\u003cp\u003eStackgl is the dark horse of this list. Stackgl is not trying to be a complete 3D engine like Three.js and Babylon.js. Stackgl is an ecosystem of small functional tools that can be composed to create 3d browser experiences. Stackgl follows the Unix philosophy of \u0026#34;small sharp tools.\u0026#34; Stackgl has some main pillars: Rendering, Math, and Data. Stackgl handles rendering by focusing on direct shader code. Babylon.js and Three.js try to abstract shaders heavily away. Stackgl\u0026#39;s primary rendering module is \u003ca href=\"http://regl.party/\"\u003eRegl\u003c/a\u003e, which provides an entirely novel stateless rendering pattern. Stackgl then provides many small functional math modules for vertex and geometry data. I was quickly more productive in Stackgl than in the previous two stacks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe modular nature made it very easy to share code between the client and server, easy to optimize performance and rendering, and easy to add custom functionality. For example, Babylon.js and Three.js have their own vector math implementation libraries. Then if you use a physics engine, the physics engines have their internal vector math libraries. Furthermore, if you use a multiplayer server, you will also need a vector math library there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\nIn Babylon and Three, it becomes a lot of fake work converting and serializing between different vector implementations. In Stackgl, you can easily use the same \u003ca href=\"https://glmatrix.net/\"\u003egl-matrix vector math library\u003c/a\u003e across a project which is a huge productivity gain.\u003ca href='/img/multiplayer-engine-post/engines.png'\u003e\n  \u003cimg src='/img/multiplayer-engine-post/engines.png'\n       alt=\"Screenshot of GitHub showing multiple game engines.\"\n       title=\"Which 3d browser engine is best?\" /\u003e\n\u003c/a\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eWhen I started progressing with Stackgl, I took a year off and worked on it full-time throughout 2017.\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eWhat went wrong\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnfortunately, I consider this project unfinished. I did not ship a complete game experience, and there are some issues with the engine that would be risky for production deployment. I\u0026#39;m writing this post to put closure on the project before moving on to new work and in the hopes that this experience may be helpful to any others interested in this space.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eReact vs. Vanilla Js\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost of my web development experience has been with the React framework, and I thought it would complement Regl and the Stackgl ecosystem\u0026#39;s functional paradigm. I created a \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/kevzettler/react-regl\"\u003ereact reconciler to bridge React and Regl\u003c/a\u003e. I started using a React stack with Redux to manage all the game state and state transitions. This React+Redux combo turned out to be a huge boon when writing UI. Game developers in traditional engines constantly complain about UI being their least favorite task. The game dev UI complaint is because game engines use geriatric 2-way mutable state management UI code that is error-prone and brittle. Web developers have solved these UI complaints and built tools like React that make creating UIs easy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ca href='/img/multiplayer-engine-post/react.gif'\u003e\n  \u003cimg src='/img/multiplayer-engine-post/react.gif'\n       alt=\"animated gif of a React 3d browser UI.\"\n       title=\"React 3d player avatar creation system\" width=\"400\" /\u003e\n\u003c/a\u003e\u003cp\u003eReact+Redux setup was too much performance overhead for the real-time gameplay section. The state updates through the Redux action reducer pipeline, and the minimal React render updates were enough to cause noticeable hiccups in the gameplay frame rate. Performance in the browser environment is susceptible to garbage collector management. To minimize garbage collector hits, you need to use object pooling. Object pooling is a mutable state management pattern in which you pre-allocate a pool of objects. The collection of allocated objects gets mutated and reused during the program\u0026#39;s life to minimize runtime memory allocations. This object pooling pattern conflicts with the immutable update patterns of React and Redux. Hitting these performance issues was a significant roadblock and essentially became a \u0026#39;rewrite\u0026#39; in which I had to rewrite the game state management to be performance optimized. This rewrite was costly and took a lot of time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eHobby time\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I started progressing with Stackgl, I took a year off and worked on it full-time throughout 2017. I lived off some savings and unemployment checks until late 2018. I got back into corporate wage slavery from 2018-2020. During this time, I was invited to Animecon 2019 indie developer section to shill my game in the Indie game section.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ca href='/img/multiplayer-engine-post/animecon.png'\u003e\n  \u003cimg src='/img/multiplayer-engine-post/animecon.png'\n       alt=\"A photo of me at Animecon 2019.\"\n       title=\"Playing a game with a 2B cosplayer at Animecon 2019\" /\u003e\n\u003c/a\u003e\u003cp\u003eDuring this time, I switched to hobby mode and started putting less and less time into development. I was maybe averaging 4 hours a week. I was distracted by day job work. This time shortage slowed development progress. Development picked up during the 2020 Covid lockdowns. Unfortunately, returning to development after a hiatus presented some new challenges.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch5\u003eSoftware entropy\u003c/h5\u003e\nThe JavaScript ecosystem is known for moving incredibly fast. I spent much time-fighting severe software entropy when I returned to development. Getting the project to build with the latest dependency chains of Node+NPM+webpack etc., took a lot of work. The animation pipeline using Landon had severe entropy. Landon is a mix of Rust, JavaScript, and Blender versions that are not strictly pinned. The Landon developer was changing the data output format and abandoned the skeletal animation system I used. I had to do work to upgrade to the latest Blender export versions but then write backward compatibility translation layers for the animation data. I upgraded my laptop to an M1 Mac. The M1 transition triggered a roadblock on the project because the WebRTC module I used would not compile on the new M1 Apple silicon chip. The WebRTC module now supports M1 architectures but was pretty much the show-stopper.\u003ch2\u003eByproducts\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe work put into this project spun off some valuable libraries I have open-sourced and put on GitHub.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/kevzettler/react-regl\"\u003ereact-regl\u003c/a\u003e\u003cp\u003eA react reconciler to bridge React and Regl\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/kevzettler/parse-magica-voxel\"\u003eparse-magica-voxel\u003c/a\u003e\u003cp\u003eA JavaScript parser for the Magicavoxel .vox binary file format\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/kevzettler/parse-qubicle\"\u003eparse-quibicle\u003c/a\u003e\u003cp\u003eA JavaScript parser for the .qb binary file format.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/kevzettler/gl-swept-sphere-triangle\"\u003egl-swept-sphere-triangle\u003c/a\u003e\u003cp\u003eA swept sphere to polygon collision detection algorithm\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eShout outs\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI built this project with the help and research of other highly skilled software engineers.

I learned about hardcore browser optimization and many other data-processing techniques. I have continued to do game ( and engine ) development as a hobby and have already looked into some other emerging technologies. My focus is still on browser multiplayer experiences. I haven\u0026#39;t found the big engines: Unreal, Unity, and Godot have the best models for multiplayer.

It is a multiplayer voxel 3d engine, all fully in the browser. DotBigBang is focused on user-generated content and is essentially a multiplayer game engine. You can get a group of people together, bring your avatars into a 3D scene, and then collaboratively edit and program that scene like a multiplayer Unity editor experience. I had the fortune to hang with the founder of DotBigBang at GDC 2023 and hear about some impressive browser performance optimization they were doing. He told me about forking Chromium to have better performance debugging visibility into how the JIT compilation and memory usage of the browser was working.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/matrix-org/thirdroom#manifold-engine\"\u003eManifold engine\u003c/a\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Manifold engine is a stealthy engine currently in development by the \u003ca href=\"https://matrix.org/\"\u003ematrix.org\u003c/a\u003e team.

It uses Web Workers to create multiple threads to process rendering, physics, and networking separately. All the threads share memory over a \u003ca href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/SharedArrayBuffer\"\u003eSharedArrayBuffer\u003c/a\u003e, and they use object pooling to reduce garbage collection. Manifold also has WebRTC Data channels for networking. I built a promising prototype in Manifold; unfortunately, Manifold is tightly coupled to a matrix.org backend. The matrix backend has a clunky API to use, which would make custom server-side optimization challenging. If the matrix.org team ever decouples and delivers Manifold, it would be a very compelling option.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/AmbientRun/Ambient\"\u003eAmbient engine\u003c/a\u003e\u003cp\u003eAmbient is a promising new Rust lang engine.

I primarily used the monitor on an OSX system.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Monitor has three primary rendering modes: \u003cb\u003eFloyd\u003c/b\u003e, \u003cb\u003eA2\u003c/b\u003e, \u003cb\u003eA16\u003c/b\u003e. I find myself spending most of the time in the \u003cb\u003eA2\u003c/b\u003e mode. The different modes correspond to different algorithms that the monitor uses to convert the colored display pixel data into grey-scale e-ink data. The numbers in the \u003cb\u003eA2\u003c/b\u003e and \u003cb\u003eA16\u003c/b\u003e modes are the different shades of grey each pixel will render. The \u003cb\u003eA2\u003c/b\u003e mode is a hard binary contrast containing only 2 colors, black and white. I found this great for text editing and reading.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe \u003cb\u003eA16\u003c/b\u003e mode maps color pixels into one of 16 shades of grey. This mode is useful for viewing operating system UI and Apps that don\u0026#39;t render well in a black and white mode.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe \u003cb\u003eFloyd\u003c/b\u003e mode is apparently a proprietary custom Dasung algorithm that is based on \u003cdel\u003e[[\u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd%E2%80%93Warshall_algorithm][The\"\u003ehttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd–Warshall_algorithm][The\u003c/a\u003e Floyd-Warshall algorithim]]\u003c/del\u003e \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd%E2%80%93Steinberg_dithering\"\u003eFloyd–Steinberg dithering algorithim\u003c/a\u003e. Overall the \u003cb\u003eFloyd\u003c/b\u003e mode renders multi shade grey output at a high frame rate. You can watch videos in this mode. Wikipedia states that:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cdel\u003ethe Floyd–Warshall algorithm is an algorithm for finding shortest paths in a weighted graph with positive or negative edge weights (but with no negative cycles).\u003c/del\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am not sure how Dasung applies that graph pathfinding algorithm to the pixel data of the display output. I haven\u0026#39;t thought too hard about this yet, I would appreciate any ideas left in the comments below.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eThe cons\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eReflective screen glare\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs you can see in the video above, there is an obvious glare on the screen. The video was captured in a moderately lit room. The monitor actually ships with a plastic anti-glare protective screen cover to help alleviate this. This is a huge problem and defeats the purpose of the monitor. Dasung\u0026#39;s advertising is aggressive on claims of \u0026#34;Relax Your Eyes\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Ultimate Eye Protection\u0026#34; \u0026#34;No blue light, No flashing, No backlight, No glossy\u0026#34;.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnfortunately, putting a reflective pane of glass over the e-ink display is a bad move.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eDasung driver and software issues\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI listed the Dasung software as a Pro, unfortunately, it also has some frustrating issues. Again my experience was on MacOSX; your experience may be different.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe monitor has a \u0026#34;change mode\u0026#34; hardware button that lets you cycle through these differnt modes. There is a software driver UI that also changes these modes. It seems the software can get out of sync with the hardware. You can set a resolution and contrast and mode in the software, Then press a hardware button and that resolution will be lost.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt times the monitor goes in to some kind of \u0026#34;sleep mode\u0026#34; even while plugged into an active computer. The screen goes black and unresponsive. By messing with a combination of the hardware buttons on the screen you can wake it up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnfortunatly, the driver UI defaults to Chinese, I was able to navigate it blindly and change to English. It should detect the operating system\u0026#39;s language setting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch1\u003eSummary\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOverall I think the Dasung is a pretty awesome piece of equipment.

Luckily they provide a \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/js-platform/node-webrtc/blob/develop/Dockerfile\"\u003eDockerfile\u003c/a\u003e which does it all for you.

Basically since Node.js came onto the spotlight and people started complaining about JavaScript code maintainability and readability due to\nnested callbacks and other asynchronous patterns. This is also highly relevant now with the rise of backbone.js and the discussion for best practices there. Writing JavaScript like Lisp is a bit of an generalization. More specifically, I mean write JavaScript like it’s a functional language, which it is.\nBy this, I mean write it as small composable functions. I\u0026#39;ll show a few patterns I use that can help keep your JavaScript more manageable. Let’s get into some code examples.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"a-standard-jquery-ajax-button-event\"\u003eA Standard jQuery Ajax Button Event.\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is fairly common pattern. A button click event triggers an Ajax request. The Ajax request has callbacks for success and error. The success callback triggers another procedure of rendering or possibly another Ajax chain.\nThe error function does some animation to the button and then does some Ajax to log the error.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cpre\u003e\u003ccode class=\"language-javascript\"\u003e    $(\u0026#39;button\u0026#39;).click(function(event){\n      $.ajax({\n        url: \u0026quot;http://coolsite.com\u0026quot;\n        ,data: {\n          \u0026quot;lots\u0026quot; : \u0026quot;of\u0026quot;\n          ,\u0026quot;json\u0026quot; : \u0026quot;data\u0026quot;\n        }\n        ,success: function(data){\n          $(\u0026#39;button\u0026#39;).fadeOut(function(){\n            alert(\u0026#39;Ajax success!\u0026#39;);\n          });\n        },\n        error: function(data){\n          $(\u0026#39;button\u0026#39;).animate({top: \u0026#39;20px\u0026#39;}, function(){\n            $.get(\u0026quot;http://coolsite.com/logger\u0026quot;, function(){\n               console.log(\u0026#39;error happened\u0026#39;);\n            });\n        });\n        }\n      });\n    });\n\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEverything is stuffed into the click handler. All of the Ajax response functions are nested in the scope of the anonymous click handler function.\nWhile this is not necessarily a bad practice, it can promote the growth of unmanageable code.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA familiar scenario, someone might declare a local variable at the top of the click handler declaration and then reference it throughout the nested anonymous functions. This will essentially cause the \u003ccode\u003esuccess\u003c/code\u003e and \u003ccode\u003eerror\u003c/code\u003e callbacks to be dependent on their nested position.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"how-can-we-make-this-better\"\u003eHow Can We Make This Better?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell lets break it up into smaller pieces. More manageable pieces.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cpre\u003e\u003ccode class=\"language-javascript\"\u003e    function ajaxSuccessHandler(data){\n      $(\u0026#39;button\u0026#39;).fadeOut(function(){\n        alert(\u0026#39;Ajax success!\u0026#39;);\n      });\n    }\n\n    function ajaxErrorHandler(data){\n      $(\u0026#39;button\u0026#39;).animate({top: data.top}, function(){\n        $.get(\u0026quot;http://coolsite.com/logger\u0026quot;, function(){\n          console.log(\u0026#39;error happened\u0026#39;);\n        });\n      });\n    }\n\n    function buttonClickHandler(event){\n      $.ajax({\n        url: \u0026quot;http://coolsite.com\u0026quot;\n        ,data: {\n          \u0026quot;lots\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;of\u0026quot;\n          ,\u0026quot;json\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;data\u0026quot;\n        }\n        ,success: ajaxSuccessHandler\n        ,error: ajaxErrorHandler\n      });\n    }\n\n    $(\u0026#39;button\u0026#39;).click(buttonClickHandler);\n\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"its-okay-to-use-named-functions\"\u003eIts Okay To Use Named Functions.\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe\u0026#39;ve made a few small abstractions. We\u0026#39;ve moved the anonymous functions that handle the button click, Ajax success, and Ajax error into separate named functions.\nSimply giving the anonymous functions names and moving them out of the nested pattern has significantly improved this code.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVisually the code is now easier to parse. The callbacks are now standalone units that can be tested in isolation.\nWe could easily write a unit test for \u003ccode\u003eajaxSuccessHandler\u003c/code\u003e that called it with a dummy data object and ensured it was functioning correctly. This is significantly harder when nesting anonymous functions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStack traces now become more useful as well. Trying to hunt down a bug in a stack trace that is 3 layers deep in anonymous functions is not helpful. If the functions are named its much easier to track down issues.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother added benefit of this pattern is that it now makes it easy to annotate our functions to utilize the features of \u003ca href=\"https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler/docs/js-for-compiler\"\u003eGoogle\u0026#39;s Closure Compiler\u003c/a\u003e.\nThis opens up the opportunity to add strict type checking to our JavaScript.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExpanding on our re-factor, we could have abstracted the anonymous callbacks passed to the \u003ccode\u003efadeOut\u003c/code\u003e and \u003ccode\u003eanimate\u003c/code\u003e invocations. Also the callback passed to our \u003ccode\u003e$.Get\u003c/code\u003e call is ripe for naming as well.\nFor this small example we\u0026#39;ll skip editing them as its a bit overkill. In larger code bases you\u0026#39;ll see those functions swell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"generate-large-objects-from-named-functions\"\u003eGenerate Large Objects From Named Functions.\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis next example is a bit exaggerated but gets the concept across.\nOften times you may have some JavaScript objects defined inline as a parameter or local variable.\nIn our example, we have the \u003ccode\u003e$.ajax\u003c/code\u003e method which takes an Object as its parameter and a child object as the \u003ccode\u003edata:\u003c/code\u003e value.\nIn our next example code, we abstract these small objects in to some simple named functions that simply return the objects.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cpre\u003e\u003ccode class=\"language-javascript\"\u003e    function ajaxSuccessHandler(data){\n      $(\u0026#39;button\u0026#39;).fadeOut(function(){\n        alert(\u0026#39;Ajax success!\u0026#39;);\n      });\n    }\n\n    function ajaxErrorHandler(data){\n      $(\u0026#39;button\u0026#39;).animate({top: data.top}, function(){\n        $.get(\u0026quot;http://coolsite.com/logger\u0026quot;, function(){\n          console.log(\u0026#39;error happened\u0026#39;);\n        });\n      });\n    }\n\n    function buttonClickAjaxData(){\n      return {\n          \u0026quot;lots\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;of\u0026quot;\n          ,\u0026quot;json\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;data\u0026quot;\n        };\n    }\n\n    function buttonClickAjaxObj(){\n      return {\n        url: \u0026quot;http://coolsite.com\u0026quot;\n        ,data: buttonClickAjaxData()\n        ,success: ajaxSuccessHandler\n        ,error: ajaxErrorHandler\n      };\n    }\n\n    function buttonClickHandler(event){\n      $.ajax(buttonClickAjaxObj());\n    }\n\n    $(\u0026#39;button\u0026#39;).click(buttonClickHandler);\n\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis abstraction lets us contain the objects in to smaller functions that can be unit tested and managed much easier.\nAgain this is an exaggerated example and a bit overkill in this case, but definitely useful for larger objects.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"just-for-fun\"\u003eJust For Fun.\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor fun let’s look at the above example in some bad pseudo Lisp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDisclaimer\u003c/strong\u003e I am by no means a certified Lisper.\nThe extent of my experience with Lisp is a few toy projects in Scheme and Common Lisp.

I chose button elements because they are generally more consistent in cross browser rendering and also allow for more semantic textual content than text in the input element\u0026#39;s type attribute.\nThe behavior of modern browsers matched my own expected behavior. That is:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eif a from element contains a button element, and no input \u003ccode\u003etype=\u0026#39;submit\u0026#39;\u003c/code\u003e, that button should trigger the submit event of the form\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, IE does not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026quot;IE will not fire a form submit event on a \u003ccode\u003e\u0026lt;button\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/button\u0026gt;\u003c/code\u003e click by default.\u0026quot;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI found this out after testing in IE and discovering that none of the forms on a site would submit.
