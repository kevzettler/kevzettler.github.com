I have many thoughts on the overall e-ink market and consumer experience. I will save them for another post. This post will be brief and focused on personal expectations with the Dasung. Additionally, there are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=dasung+paperlike+pro">many other, more thorough reviews</a> online demonstrating the capabilities of the monitor.</p>
<p>After telling people I purchased this monitor the common reaction is:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#34;E-ink? Isn&#39;t that slow!? How do you code on that?&#34; - Tech Friend</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is an understandable concern as most people&#39;s personal experience with E-ink has been on smaller low powered devices like Kindles or other E-readers.  The smaller e-reader screens tend to have an extended &#39;refresh&#39; rate built in. This is an attempt to conserve battery power.</p>
<p>The Dasung doesn&#39;t have to make this compromise; it has a dedicated power source. The Dasung monitor performance runs at about 40 FPS on HDMI hookup. This thing can play videos.</p>
<h2>Coding in Emacs on a Dasung Paperlike Pro 13.3 E-ink monitor</h2>
<p>Below is a video I sent to a few friends demonstrating the responsiveness and performance</p>
<p>e-ink emacs video:</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zp8-eUmAnhg" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe><h2>The pros</h2>
<ul><li>The overall physical design and form factor of the monitor is great.<p>The monitor has a solid one-piece construction. As a bonus, it comes with a stand. HDMI hookup</p>
</li>
<li>Works excellent for Emacs.<p>Can be a dedicated Emacs monitor.</p>
</li>
<li>Dasung support was fast, friendly and shipping was quick.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Dasung driver and software performance</h3>
<p>Dasung packages software to help drive and configure the monitor on popular operating systems: Windows, OSX, and 64bit Ubuntu. I primarily used the monitor on an OSX system.</p>
<p>The Monitor has three primary rendering modes: <b>Floyd</b>, <b>A2</b>, <b>A16</b>. I find myself spending most of the time in the <b>A2</b> mode. The different modes correspond to different algorithms that the monitor uses to convert the colored display pixel data into grey-scale e-ink data. The numbers in the <b>A2</b> and <b>A16</b> modes are the different shades of grey each pixel will render. The <b>A2</b> mode is a hard binary contrast containing only 2 colors, black and white. I found this great for text editing and reading.</p>
<p>The <b>A16</b> mode maps color pixels into one of 16 shades of grey. This mode is useful for viewing operating system UI and Apps that don&#39;t render well in a black and white mode.</p>
<p>The <b>Floyd</b> mode is apparently a proprietary custom Dasung algorithm that is based on <del>[[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd%E2%80%93Warshall_algorithm][The">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd–Warshall_algorithm][The</a> Floyd-Warshall algorithim]]</del> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd%E2%80%93Steinberg_dithering">Floyd–Steinberg dithering algorithim</a>. Overall the <b>Floyd</b> mode renders multi shade grey output at a high frame rate. You can watch videos in this mode. Wikipedia states that:</p>
<blockquote><p><del>the Floyd–Warshall algorithm is an algorithm for finding shortest paths in a weighted graph with positive or negative edge weights (but with no negative cycles).</del></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I am not sure how Dasung applies that graph pathfinding algorithm to the pixel data of the display output. I haven&#39;t thought too hard about this yet, I would appreciate any ideas left in the comments below.</p>
<h2>The cons</h2>
<h3>Reflective screen glare</h3>
<p>As you can see in the video above, there is an obvious glare on the screen. The video was captured in a moderately lit room. The monitor actually ships with a plastic anti-glare protective screen cover to help alleviate this. This is a huge problem and defeats the purpose of the monitor. Dasung&#39;s advertising is aggressive on claims of &#34;Relax Your Eyes&#34;, &#34;Ultimate Eye Protection&#34; &#34;No blue light, No flashing, No backlight, No glossy&#34;.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, putting a reflective pane of glass over the e-ink display is a bad move.</p>
<h3>Dasung driver and software issues</h3>
<p>I listed the Dasung software as a Pro, unfortunately, it also has some frustrating issues. Again my experience was on MacOSX; your experience may be different.</p>
<p>The monitor has a &#34;change mode&#34; hardware button that lets you cycle through these differnt modes. There is a software driver UI that also changes these modes. It seems the software can get out of sync with the hardware. You can set a resolution and contrast and mode in the software, Then press a hardware button and that resolution will be lost.</p>
<p>At times the monitor goes in to some kind of &#34;sleep mode&#34; even while plugged into an active computer. The screen goes black and unresponsive. By messing with a combination of the hardware buttons on the screen you can wake it up.</p>
<p>Unfortunatly, the driver UI defaults to Chinese, I was able to navigate it blindly and change to English. It should detect the operating system&#39;s language setting.</p>
<h1>Summary</h1>
<p>Overall I think the Dasung is a pretty awesome piece of equipment. I am majorly dissapointed about the reflective glass screen. I am happy with my purchase and hope funds go to help further improve the company and product line. If you spend a lot of time editing text or reading with tired eyes I would recommend one. You can use it as a dedicated text editor or terminal screen to great success.</p>
