#+TITLE: The E-ink Experience
#+LAYOUT: post
#+TAGS: hardware workflow

I spend a lot of time staring at screens. Alternating between laptop/desktop and mobile phone. My eyes get strained, things get blurry and I have to stop. I feel that I can't be as productive as I like.

I spend a lot of this time doing:
  + consumption activities
    + news
    + white papers
    + technical blogs
    + books
  + creation activities
    + writing
    + coding


 I am a big fan of E-ink monitors.
