** Building a DIY E-ink laptop
This is a follow up to my previous [[dasung-paperlike-pro-review.html][Dasung Paperlike Pro Review]] post. For visitors landing here, a quick recap. The Dasung Paperlike Pro is billed as "The worlds first HDMI e-ink monitor" It is high performance for a e-ink display and renders at about 40fps. Check the review post for more info.

 I Bought the Dasung with intentions to tear it down for 'research' purposes. Mainly to confirm what e-ink display module they were using. This research was for the goal of building an e-ink laptop. In this post I will walk through my experience dismantling the Dasung and discuss its internal components. Hopefully readers will find this useful in their own e-ink hardware projects, or in the chance they need to repair a Dasung.

** How to open the Dasung Paperlike Pro
The Dasung has a seemingly, solid one piece construction. It took me a few days to devise a method of disassembly that wasn't aggressively destructive, like cracking the frame open with a hammer, or pry-bar. After prodding it for a few days I discovered the front outer frame bezel was glued on and could be pried with a knife.

** The Dasung E-ink Display Module

My main objective in purchasing the Dasung, was to confirm what e-ink display module was in use. I had suspected it was the [[http://shopkits.eink.com/product/13-3%CB%9D-epaper-display-ed133ut2/][13.3Àù ePaper Display (ED133UT2)]] However other notes from Dasung about a "Carta" version change lead me to doubt that. One of my biggest complaints in my [[dasung-paperlike-pro-review.html][Dasung Paperlike Pro Review]] post, was that the monitor display was reflective and has an aggressive glare.

*** Detaching the E-ink display module
This step was sensitive. The Display module is attached by a fragile ribbon cable to a latch bracket

** The Control Board
When I first saw this control board I was shocked at how large it was and how many components were packed into it.

On further look all the chip components have had their labels chemically peeled off to prevernt reverse engineering.
