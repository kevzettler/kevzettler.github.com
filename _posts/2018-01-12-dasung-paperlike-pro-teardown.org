Oops, you have lost the warranty :-(

** Building an E-ink laptop
This is a follow up to my previous [Dasung Paperlike Pro Review] post. For visitors landing here, a quick recap. The Dasung Paperlike Pro is billed as "The worlds first HDMI e-ink monitor" It is high performance for traditional e-ink and renders at about 40fps. Check the review post for more info.

 I Bought the Dasung with intentions to tear it down for 'research' purposes. This research was for the goal of building an e-ink laptop. In this post I will walk through my experience dismantling the Dasung and discuss its internal components. Hopefully readers will find this useful in their own e-ink hardware projects, or in the chance they need to repair a Dasung.

** How to open the Dasung Paperlike Pro
The Dasung has a seemingly, solid one piece construction. It took me a few days to devise a method of disassembly that wasn't aggressively destructive, like cracking the frame open with a hammer, or pry-bar. After prodding it for a few days I discovered the front outer frame bezel was glued on and could be pried with a knife.

** The Dasung E-ink Display Module

My main objective in purchasing the Dasung, was to confirm what e-ink display module was in use. I had suspected it was the [[http://shopkits.eink.com/product/13-3%CB%9D-epaper-display-ed133ut2/][13.3Àù ePaper Display (ED133UT2)]] However other notes from Dasung about a "Carta" version. One of my biggest complaints in my [Dasung Paperlike Pro Review] post, was that the monitor display was reflective and has an aggressive glare.
