* If you want to us ipv6 with docker.io on linode make sure you have the following `sysctl` set
  * `net.ipv6.conf.all.accept_ra = 2`
  * `net.ipv6.conf.all.forwarding = 1`
* Then you can pretty much follow this post [http://zargony.com/2013/10/13/ipv6-in-docker-containers](http://zargony.com/2013/10/13/ipv6-in-docker-containers#sthash.xNFG3NCx.dpuf)
* If you want auto configured addresses you can install and configure `radvd`
